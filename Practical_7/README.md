git clone https://github.com/choden12/web101_02240355.git
cd Data-Visualisation

2. **Install Dependencies**
npm install

## Usages
- View monthly sales trends through a Line Chart.
- Analyze product category distribution using a Pie Chart.
- Monitor customer acquisition growth with a Bar Chart.
- Track weekly visitor activity via an Area Chart.
- Gain insights through responsive, real-time visualizations.

## Features

- nBar Chart (Chart.js) – Customer Acquisition
- Area Chart (Chart.js) – Weekly Visitors
- Dynamic data handling and rendering
- Easy integration of multiple chart libraries
- Responsive and interactive UI

## Technologies
React – JavaScript library for building UIs
Recharts – Declarative charting for React
react-chartjs-2 – React wrapper for Chart.js
Chart.js – Flexible charting library
Vite – Fast dev environment and bundler

## Conclusion
- This project offers a hands-on understanding of implementing multiple charting libraries in a React environment. It illustrates how to transform raw data into insightful and interactive visualizations while maintaining clean and reusable component architecture.

## Acknowledgments
- I would like to thank my instructor for providing clear guidance throughout this practical. I also acknowledge the developers and communities behind Recharts and Chart.js for their powerful and user-friendly charting libraries. Their documentation and examples were instrumental in building responsive and interactive visualizations. Special thanks to the repository author for the starter project that laid the groundwork for this implementation.
