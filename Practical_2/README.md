## Installation

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**
   git clone <https://github.com/choden12/web101_02240355.git>
   cd your-project-folder
2. Run the Application
- Simply open index.html in any modern web browser.
- No server setup required.

## Usages
GET – Fetch live weather data for a city using OpenWeatherMap API.
POST – Save favorite locations using the JSONPlaceholder fake API.
PUT – Update existing location information.
DELETE – Remove a saved location from the list.
Test full REST operations in a browser-friendly UI.

## Features
- Tabbed interface for organized operation views
- Real-time weather lookup by city
- Fake database interactions (POST, PUT, DELETE) using JSONPlaceholder
- Responsive and interactive form handling
- Modal support for editing saved data
- Clear display of API responses and error handling

## Technologies
- HTML5 – For structure and layout
- CSS3 – Basic styling
- JavaScript (ES6) – Logic, API calls, and UI interaction
- OpenWeatherMap API – For retrieving real weather data
- JSONPlaceholder API – For mock POST/PUT/DELETE operations

## Conclusion
- This project is a practical exercise in integrating RESTful API operations into a simple frontend application. It strengthens your understanding of HTTP verbs, API endpoints, asynchronous JavaScript (fetch), and DOM manipulation—all without needing a backend server setup.

## Acknowledgments
- I would like to thank my instructor and peers for their valuable guidance and feedback throughout this project. Special appreciation goes to the developers and contributors of the open-source libraries and tools such as Node.js, Express.js, and Morgan, which greatly facilitated the development process. Additionally, I’m grateful for the online resources and communities that provided support and best practices for building robust RESTful APIs.
