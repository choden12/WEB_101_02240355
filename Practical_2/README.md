## Installation

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**
   git clone <https://github.com/choden12/web101_02240355.git>
   cd your-project-folder
2. Run the Application
- Simply open index.html in any modern web browser.
- No server setup required.

## Usages
GET – Fetch live weather data for a city using OpenWeatherMap API.
POST – Save favorite locations using the JSONPlaceholder fake API.
PUT – Update existing location information.
DELETE – Remove a saved location from the list.
Test full REST operations in a browser-friendly UI.

## Features
- Tabbed interface for organized operation views
- Real-time weather lookup by city
- Fake database interactions (POST, PUT, DELETE) using JSONPlaceholder
- Responsive and interactive form handling
- Modal support for editing saved data
- Clear display of API responses and error handling

## Technologies
- HTML5 – For structure and layout
- CSS3 – Basic styling
- JavaScript (ES6) – Logic, API calls, and UI interaction
- OpenWeatherMap API – For retrieving real weather data
- JSONPlaceholder API – For mock POST/PUT/DELETE operations

## Conclusion
- This project is a practical exercise in integrating RESTful API operations into a simple frontend application. It strengthens your understanding of HTTP verbs, API endpoints, asynchronous JavaScript (fetch), and DOM manipulation—all without needing a backend server setup.
